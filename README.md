My approach to this problem was to use Binary Search tree algorithm to easily sort through the courses and palce them in a tree. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
To over come the roadblkocks, I tried to understand the program requirements and i took advantageod of all the reousrce availble to us through SNHU. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It helped me understadn what steps should be taken to for a functional software design and code writing.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The instructions and course material helped me write a better and cleaner code that is functional.
